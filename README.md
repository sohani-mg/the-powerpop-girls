# THE RISE OF THE POWERPOP GIRLS

## Description of what I aimed to accomplish: <br>
Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Charli XCX are everywhere in pop culture at the moment. They appear to be overnight successes so I thought it would be interesting to track their rise in popularity over the last few years. 

## Visualisation choices: Why use The Powerpuff Girls? Why hand-drawn charts? <br>
Since Sabrina, Chappell and Charli are known for the colours blue (the colour of Sabrina's last album), red (Chappell is known for her red locks) and green (Charli's album brat is a lime green colour), I decided to use that colour palette. I also saw that this tweet went viral: https://www.instagram.com/p/C8xntBbyHI0/ and thought I would use The Powerpuff Girls to showcase their rise (changing puff to pop for obvious reasons!). Since these three women are young, I thought it would be a good idea to draw my own version of the powerpuff girls and trace over the graphs collected so it gives the piece a youthful feel.  

## Description of findings: <br>
I found that Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan have exponentially increased their average monthly listeners on Spotify while Charli XCX has had a turbulent time. I also found what events may have led to their popularity and plotted them on the graph. Nevertheless, Charli's latest album is still her most successful to date and she has a tour coming up so that might make her rise go even further up if we wait a few more months. 

## Data collection and analysis process: <br>
I used the Chartmetric API to find historical data on Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. The data I collected was Spotify monthly listeners. So it's easier to fathom what all the numbers mean I also collected data from well known artists such as Justin Bieber and Alicia Keys. To highlight how extraordinary Sabrina Carpenter's virality is, I also displayed Fred Again's data since he was also an artist that went viral this year and was nominated for Best New Artist in 2024.

## Where you grew the most during the project: <br>
I got A LOT more comfortable using APIs during this process as well as manipulating lists of dictionaries. I went through many different rabbit holes till I found appropriate data that would showcase their audience growth. 

## Things I tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time: <br>
I tried to do ai2html scrollytelling but since I did most of the drawings in procreate instead of Adobe Illustrator I could not figure out how to get it to work. So I resorted to doing it with images instead! I also tried to search the Chartmetric API for the top tracks for each artist but I kept running into dead ends and couldn't find the data to present. Since I had quite a lot of data already I decided not to pursue that angle as well.
